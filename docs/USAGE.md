- One comment per line

**Example Good Comments:**
```
Thanks for this tutorial! Really well explained.
The section at 2:30 was particularly helpful.

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Commenting Strategy

   Batch 3: Comments 41-60
   ```

   - Enable randomization
   - Less likely to trigger limits

3. **Schedule Breaks**
   - Run for 20 comments
   - Take a 5-minute break
   - Resume with next batch
